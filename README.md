Please, read the [preview](assets/preview-fourth-edition.pdf) to understand what this book offers and who should read it.

## Editions

This repository contains the material associated with the **fourth edition** of the book. The notebooks associated to the previous editions can be downloaded from the **Releases** page, which can be found on the right hand side of the screen.

## Notebooks [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Davide-sd/sympy-book/HEAD)

The repository contains a list of notebooks, each one named after a chapter. Notebooks only contain the code: they are meant to be followed by Readers. The explanations for the code can be found in the book.

Some chapters offers an *Advanced Topics* section, which is meant to be optional but highly recommended.

**The chapters containing exercises are not included in this repository**: this is done intentionally to force the Readers to actively follow the book, code their attempts and understand the different steps, hence gaining experience with SymPy.

You can try the notebooks without downloading or installing the software by clicking the following button:

## Code

The following code files are included in the repository, which are going to be used by some notebooks:

* `sympy_utils.py`: it contains functions and classes that can be useful to any SymPy user.
